# A portfolio repository of Data Science Projects worked on.


# [Project 1: Battle for Neighborhoods.](https://github.com/Diwura/Capstone-Project-IBM-)
### Final Project for IBM Data Science Professional Course: Project Overview
* Made use of the Foursquare API to get location data.
* K-Means Clustering algorithm from the python scipy package was used to determine relationship between different neighborhoods in Toronto.
* Web scraping using BeautifulSoup to get Geo-data (Latitude and Longitude) of neighborhoods in the different boroughs in Toronto
* Pandas and Numpy mehtods were used for the Data wrangling.
* The Folium package was used to create map visualizations using the Geo-data.
