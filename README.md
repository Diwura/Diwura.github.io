# A portfolio repository of Data Science Projects worked on.


# [Project 1: Battle for Neighborhoods.](https://github.com/Diwura/Capstone-Project-IBM-)
### Final Project for IBM Data Science Professional Course: Project Overview
* Made use of the Foursquare API to get location data.
* K-Means Clustering algorithm from the python scipy package was used to determine relationship between different neighborhoods in Toronto.
* Web scraping using BeautifulSoup to get Geo-data (Latitude and Longitude) of neighborhoods in the different boroughs in Toronto
* Pandas and Numpy mehtods were used for the Data wrangling.
* The Folium package was used to create map visualizations using the Geo-data.

<p> Final Results: Based on the outcome of the analysis a business case was proposed for which location will be best for setting up an African resturant. A detailed report of this business case is in the pdf file tittled. "torontoReport.pdf"</p>

# [Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Wrangling](https://github.com/Diwura/Data_Analysis_via_Python)
### Data_Analysis_via_Python - Project overview:
This repo contains step by step instructions on Data Analysis using python on Jupyter Lab. It is currently a two series notebook on Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis
The automobiles.csv file is the dataset we would be working with in an attempt to predict the sales price of a car.
